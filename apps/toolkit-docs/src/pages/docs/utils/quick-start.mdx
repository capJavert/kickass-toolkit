# Quick start

<Callout type="info">DOCS COMING SOON</Callout>

We are building docs for this, while we are doing that you can [check out the source code](https://github.com/kickassCoderz/kickass-toolkit/tree/master/packages/utils). It has full typescript support, docs and tests so you should find no issue in using those as a reference.
